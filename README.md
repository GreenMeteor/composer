# [HumHub](https://humhub.com/en) Composer

The HumHub Composer module offers a streamlined solution for managing dependencies within the HumHub platform, providing administrators with automated dependency updates and Composer self-updates directly from the admin interface. The module leverages the ComposerController to execute Composer commands based on predefined conditions, ensuring that HumHub installations remain up-to-date with the latest dependencies and Composer releases.

## Features

- **Automated Dependency Management:** The module automates the process of updating HumHub's dependencies by executing Composer commands based on predefined conditions. This approach simplifies maintenance tasks and keeps installations current with minimal effort.
  
- **Self-Update Capability:** In addition to updating HumHub dependencies, the module enables self-updating Composer through the ComposerController. Administrators can seamlessly keep Composer up-to-date with the latest releases directly from the admin interface.
  
- **GitController Integration:** The module includes a GitController, which facilitates pulling changes from the GitHub repository (such as HumHub's GitHub repository) into the specified directory. It handles the update process by interacting with the GitHub repository, fetching changes, and updating the HumHub installation accordingly. After fetching changes, the GitController copies files and directories from the cloned repository into the specified directory, excluding specific files and directories as required. Upon completing the update process, the GitController provides feedback to the administrator via success or error messages, enhancing the overall user experience.
  
- **Flexible Command Execution:** The ComposerController dynamically determines the Composer command to execute (`install`, `update`, or `self-update`) based on predefined conditions. This flexibility allows administrators to customize the update process according to specific deployment requirements.
  
- **Enhanced Stability and Security:** By automating dependency updates and Composer self-updates, the module enhances the stability and security of HumHub installations. Administrators can ensure that installations remain current with the latest patches and improvements, minimizing potential vulnerabilities.
